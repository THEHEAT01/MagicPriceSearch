# MagicPriceSearch
A website to enable users to setup price watches on magic cards. Users can login and on the home page see the cards they have setup price searches for, or create new "watches" on a form page. 

The service will get prices from TCG Player & Card Kingdom (eventually starcitygames as well) every hour and update prices and show the difference from the last price.
